# spam-number-finder-project

I'm excited to share that I've just finished building a web app called "Spam Number Finder" using Django Rest Framework and JavaScript. With this app, you can manage your contacts easily by adding, deleting, editing, and fetching them from a global database. Plus, you can mark any contacts as spam and avoid future unwanted calls.
When you load the app, you'll see a personalized view that only shows your belongings. The app also features a search function that allows you to quickly check whether a number is spam or not. If the number is present in our database, you'll get all the relevant details about it, but if it's not, the app will indicate that the number is potentially spam.
I'm thrilled to have created an app that helps users better manage their contacts and avoid spam calls. As a beginner developer, this project has taught me a lot about working with Django Rest Framework and JavaScript, and I'm excited to continue improving my skills.
