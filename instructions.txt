Hello ,

Please follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

Install all the required modules by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your Python environment if they are not already installed.

Add your MySQL database credentials in the "settings.py" file as shown below:

DATABASES = {
'default': {
'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
'NAME': 'your_database_name',
'USER': 'your_username',
'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
'HOST': 'localhost',
'PORT': '3306',
}
}

Run the command "python manage.py collectstatic" to collect all the static files.[NOTE: some functions are developed using javascript.]

Run the command "python manage.py makemigrations" to generate the migration files for the database models.

Run the command "python manage.py migrate" to apply the migration files to the database.

Finally, run the command "python manage.py runserver" to start the server and access the project in your web browser.
